#Install
To download. 
* Click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder SimpleScreen. 
* Check that the SimpleScreen folder contains SimpleScreen.cpp and SimpleScreen.h.

#Example
Alphabet-Screen.ino simply writes A-J to each column and repeats for each row.

This is the same example that exists in the NokiaLCD library, 
with the exception that the SimpleScreen class is now used.
